// 4 major pillars of OOPS Encapsulation , inheritance , Polymorphism , Abstraction.

// Encapsulation = is defined as the (wrapping  up) of data & methods under a single unit. is also implement data hiding.

// Inheritance = is when properties & methods of (base) class are passed on to a (derived) class.

// Polymorphism = many forms (doing same work but using different forms)

// Abstraction = Hiding all the unnecessary detail and showing only the important parts to the user.

        // Scanner class with it's sc name object
